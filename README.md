# MyTeam

## Welcome to MyTeam builder. This app would be useful to build your Team Porfolio
### Let's see how to work with this app
#### 1. User would be presented with a series of questions, like Name, Email ID, Office Number, Role selection etc.,
#### 2. Questions that pop up differ based on role selected. For example, Manager role will not have few questions that are not similar to Intern's role or Engineer's            role
#### 3. After adding details for on employee, user would be asked either to enter details for more employees or choose to exit the app.
#### 4. if user chooses to enter details of more employees, he will be presented with next set of questions based on which role he selects (Intern or Engineer)
#### 5. User cannot enter Intern or Engineer role details unless Manager details are filled out first
#### 6. Once a Manager is created, any number of roles can be filled under him
